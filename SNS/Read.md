## What is AWS SNS?

AWS Simple Notification Service (SNS) is a fully managed messaging service that allows you to send notifications or messages to multiple 

subscribers using various communication channels.

### Key Features of SNS

 Publish-Subscribe Model â†’ One-to-many messaging system
 
 Multiple Protocols Supported â†’ Email, SMS, HTTP, AWS Lambda, SQS
 
 Event-Driven â†’ Works well with AWS services like S3, EC2, Lambda
 
 Scalable & Serverless â†’ Automatically handles high traffic
 
 FIFO Topics â†’ Ensures message ordering and deduplication (for SQS)

### How AWS SNS Works

 Publisher sends a message to an SNS Topic.

 SNS Topic distributes the message to all subscribers.

 Subscribers (Email, SMS, HTTP, SQS, Lambda) receive the message.

ðŸ“Œ Example: You create an SNS topic and subscribe your email to it. When a message is published, AWS SNS sends an email notification to your inbox.

### Types of SNS Topics

#### Standard Topic (default)

High throughput, best-effort delivery

Messages may be delivered out of order

Supports all subscribers (Email, SMS, HTTP, Lambda, SQS)

Use case: General notifications (e.g., system alerts, user notifications)

### FIFO (First-In-First-Out) Topic

Exactly-once delivery

Only supports AWS SQS as a subscriber

Use case: Financial transactions, inventory management
